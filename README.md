4. summary: My app is intended for users to be able to find their drink of choice in any location they specific, it has been set to go by city
and state, and although the name indicated it would be intended for coffee it can be used to find all kinds of drinks or rather shops
that offer those beverages such as coffee, tea, beer, etc.


5. Technologies: I used html, css, javascript, and jquery to make this project function as well as ajax and json.
